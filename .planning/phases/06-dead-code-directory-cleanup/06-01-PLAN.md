<objective>
Remove all unused component files and empty scaffolded directories from the codebase.

Purpose: Eliminate dead code noise that confuses developers and increases cognitive load. These files were identified in CONCERNS.md as unused (~517 lines total) and serve no purpose.

Output: Cleaner codebase with only actively-used code. 3 component files deleted, 31 empty directories removed.

Files to remove (pre-verified as unused):

- components/dashboard-background.tsx (355 lines, not imported anywhere)
- components/mobile-hero.tsx (~125 lines, not imported anywhere)
- components/live-metric-widget.tsx (37 lines, only imported by mobile-hero.tsx)

Directories to remove (pre-verified as empty):

- app/designs/: 15 empty theme directories (artdeco, bento, blueprint, brutalist, editorial, glass, isometric, newspaper, noir, organic, pixel, synthwave, terminal, vaporwave, zen)
- components/designs/: 16 empty theme directories (same as above plus shared)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove unused component files</name>
  <files>
    components/dashboard-background.tsx
    components/mobile-hero.tsx
    components/live-metric-widget.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Delete the three unused component files. These were verified as orphaned - no imports exist anywhere in the codebase.

    Order of deletion matters: delete live-metric-widget.tsx first (it's imported by mobile-hero.tsx, which is also being deleted), then mobile-hero.tsx, then dashboard-background.tsx.

    Use `rm` command for each file. Do NOT use git rm - we want clean working tree removal.

  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: `ls components/dashboard-background.tsx components/mobile-hero.tsx components/live-metric-widget.tsx 2>&1`
    Expected: All three should return "No such file or directory"
  </verify>
  <done>
    Three unused component files no longer exist in components/ directory
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove empty scaffolded directories</name>
  <files>
    app/designs/ (entire directory tree)
    components/designs/ (entire directory tree)
  </files>
  <action>
    Remove all empty theme directories that were scaffolded but never implemented.

    app/designs/ contains 15 empty subdirectories:
    artdeco, bento, blueprint, brutalist, editorial, glass, isometric, newspaper, noir, organic, pixel, synthwave, terminal, vaporwave, zen

    components/designs/ contains 16 empty subdirectories:
    Same 15 as above plus "shared"

    Use `rm -rf` to remove entire directory trees. After removal, if the parent designs/ directories are empty, remove those too.

    Commands:
    - rm -rf app/designs
    - rm -rf components/designs

  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: `ls -d app/designs components/designs 2>&1`
    Expected: Both should return "No such file or directory"
  </verify>
  <done>
    31 empty scaffolded directories no longer exist. app/designs/ and components/designs/ directories completely removed.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify build and runtime</name>
  <files>None (verification only)</files>
  <action>
    Verify the project still compiles and runs after removals:

    1. Run `npm run build` - should complete without errors
    2. Run `npm run dev` briefly to confirm dev server starts (can kill after seeing "Ready")

    If build fails with import errors, that means a file we deleted was actually used somewhere. This would indicate our pre-verification was incomplete. In that case, restore the file from git and investigate.

    Expected: Build succeeds because these files were verified as unused before deletion.

  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: `npm run build`
    Expected: Exit code 0, output contains "Compiled successfully" or similar success message
  </verify>
  <done>
    Project compiles and runs correctly after dead code removal
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After all tasks complete:

1. Confirm deleted files are gone:
   - `ls components/dashboard-background.tsx` → "No such file"
   - `ls components/mobile-hero.tsx` → "No such file"
   - `ls components/live-metric-widget.tsx` → "No such file"

2. Confirm directories are removed:
   - `ls -d app/designs` → "No such file or directory"
   - `ls -d components/designs` → "No such file or directory"

3. Confirm build passes:
   - `npm run build` → exits 0

4. Confirm no lingering references:
   - `grep -r "dashboard-background\|mobile-hero\|live-metric-widget" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .` → no results

<success_criteria>

- 3 unused component files deleted (~517 lines of dead code removed)
- 31 empty directories deleted (15 in app/designs, 16 in components/designs)
- `npm run build` passes without errors
- No import errors or runtime crashes
- Git shows clean deletions ready for atomic commit
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-dead-code-directory-cleanup/06-01-SUMMARY.md`

Commit message format:

```
