<objective>
Extract the Hero and About sections from page-content.tsx into dedicated "use client" wrapper components in components/sections/.

Purpose: Hero and About are the last two animated sections still inline in page-content.tsx. Extracting them completes the "every animated section in a wrapper" pattern required by Phase 10 success criteria #1.

Output: Two new wrapper components (hero-section.tsx, about-section.tsx) and a slimmer page-content.tsx that imports them.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extract Hero section into hero-section.tsx</name>
  <files>components/sections/hero-section.tsx, components/page-content.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `components/sections/hero-section.tsx` as a "use client" component.

**Props interface:** The hero section uses `heroScale` and `heroOpacity` which are `MotionValue<number>` from framer-motion (created by `useTransform` in page-content.tsx). These must be passed as props:

```typescript
import type { MotionValue } from "framer-motion";

type HeroSectionProps = {
  heroScale: MotionValue<number>;
  heroOpacity: MotionValue<number>;
};
```

**Content to extract:** Move lines 114-165 from page-content.tsx (the `<motion.section>` with sticky hero) into this component. The hero renders:

- `<TwinklingStars />` (import from @/components/twinkling-stars)
- Giant "MANNAN" heading with text stroke
- Orange accent line
- "SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER" subtitle
- Scroll indicator with bouncing animation

All framer-motion imports (`motion`) stay in this file. The `style={{ scale: heroScale, opacity: heroOpacity }}` on the root `<motion.section>` uses the prop values.

**Do NOT move:** The `useScroll`/`useTransform` hooks stay in page-content.tsx because they need the `containerRef` (the `<main>` element). The hero component receives the computed motion values.

**In page-content.tsx:** Replace the inline hero JSX (lines 114-165) with `<HeroSection heroScale={heroScale} heroOpacity={heroOpacity} />`. Add the import.
</action>
<verify> - `grep -c "use client" components/sections/hero-section.tsx` returns 1 - `grep -c "motion" components/sections/hero-section.tsx` confirms framer-motion usage - `grep -c "HeroSection" components/page-content.tsx` shows import + render - Hero section JSX no longer inline in page-content.tsx (lines 114-165 replaced) - `npx next build` succeeds without type errors
</verify>
<done>hero-section.tsx exists as a "use client" component with framer-motion, receives heroScale/heroOpacity as MotionValue props, and page-content.tsx renders it instead of inline JSX</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Extract About section into about-section.tsx</name>
  <files>components/sections/about-section.tsx, components/page-content.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `components/sections/about-section.tsx` as a "use client" component.

**Props interface:** The About section uses `backgroundPattern` (module-level array of `{ top, left, rotate }` objects). Pass this as a prop:

```typescript
type BackgroundPatternItem = {
  top: number;
  left: number;
  rotate: number;
};

type AboutSectionProps = {
  backgroundPattern: BackgroundPatternItem[];
};
```

**Content to extract:** Move lines 174-248 from page-content.tsx (the split-screen about section) into this component. The about section renders:

- Left panel: background pattern overlay (M characters at random positions), "4+" years display
- Right panel: "About" label, "BUILDING INTERFACES THAT FEEL ALIVE" heading, two paragraphs of bio text
- All right-panel text uses framer-motion `whileInView` animations

Import `motion` from framer-motion in this file. The `backgroundPattern` data comes via props.

**Module-level computation stays in page-content.tsx:** The `bgRandom` / `backgroundPattern` generation (lines 40-45) stays in page-content.tsx because it uses `mulberry32` which is a pure function safe for server components. It will be passed as a prop to AboutSection.

**In page-content.tsx:** Replace the inline about JSX (lines 174-248) with `<AboutSection backgroundPattern={backgroundPattern} />`. Add the import. Remove the `{/* About section - Split screen */}` comment since it's now self-documenting.
</action>
<verify> - `grep -c "use client" components/sections/about-section.tsx` returns 1 - `grep "whileInView" components/sections/about-section.tsx` confirms framer-motion usage - `grep -c "AboutSection" components/page-content.tsx` shows import + render - About section JSX no longer inline in page-content.tsx - `npx next build` succeeds without type errors
</verify>
<done>about-section.tsx exists as a "use client" component with framer-motion whileInView animations, receives backgroundPattern as props, and page-content.tsx renders it instead of inline JSX</done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. `npx next build` completes without errors
2. `grep -rn "use client" components/sections/hero-section.tsx components/sections/about-section.tsx` shows both files have "use client" directive
3. `grep -c "motion\." components/page-content.tsx` -- hero/about motion elements no longer inline (only the nav's `<motion.section>` wrapper for scroll should remain, which is the sticky hero import)
4. page-content.tsx imports and renders `<HeroSection>` and `<AboutSection>` with appropriate props
5. No framer-motion imports removed from page-content.tsx (it still needs useScroll, useTransform for the hero parallax)
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Hero section extracted into components/sections/hero-section.tsx with "use client" and framer-motion
- About section extracted into components/sections/about-section.tsx with "use client" and framer-motion
- page-content.tsx renders both via imports, no inline hero/about JSX remains
- Build passes with no type errors
  </success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-client-boundary-extraction/10-04-SUMMARY.md`
