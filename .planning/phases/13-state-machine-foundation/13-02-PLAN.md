<objective>
Visually verify the state machine reveal works correctly: click trigger, reverse-chronological order, no fitView, and clean abort behavior.

Purpose: Confirm the foundation is solid before building camera choreography on top of it.
Output: Human verification that all Phase 13 success criteria are met visually.

  <what-built>
State machine reveal system: click root node to trigger career reveal in reverse-chronological order (Intenseye -> Layermark -> Bilkent). Removed mouse-enter trigger and fitView auto-zoom.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000 in a desktop browser (1024px+ width)
2. Scroll to the graph section
3. Verify: Root "Mannan Abdul" node is visible with a subtle "click to explore career" hint text
4. Verify: Mouse-enter on the graph container does NOT start any reveal
5. Click the root "Mannan Abdul" node
6. Verify: Soft-skill nodes appear first (Problem-Solving, Collaboration, Quick-Learner)
7. Verify: Then Intenseye appears (with edge from root)
8. Verify: Then Layermark appears (with edge from root)
9. Verify: Then Bilkent appears (with edge from root)
10. Verify: The graph does NOT auto-zoom or fitView at any point during the reveal
11. Verify: Hovering company/education nodes still shows achievement nodes (existing behavior preserved)
12. Navigate away from the page during a reveal (or resize), then return -- verify no console errors about setState on unmounted component
