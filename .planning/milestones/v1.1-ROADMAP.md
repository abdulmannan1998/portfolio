# Milestone v1.1: Codebase Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-07
**Phases:** 6-8
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

Remove dead code, clean up file structure, implement proper code splitting, and address technical debt from CONCERNS.md audit.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Dead Code & Directory Cleanup

**Goal**: Eliminate unused code and empty directory scaffolds to reduce codebase noise
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.1)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 06-01: Remove unused components and empty scaffolded directories

**Details:**

- Removed 3 unused component files (dashboard-background.tsx, mobile-hero.tsx, live-metric-widget.tsx) totaling 516 lines
- Removed 31 empty scaffolded theme directories (15 in app/designs/, 16 in components/designs/)
- Build verified clean after removals

### Phase 7: Code Splitting

**Goal**: Extract inline components from page.tsx into dedicated files for maintainability
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (clean slate after dead code removal)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 07-01: Extract techStack data and inline components (MarqueeText, AnimatedCounter, GitHubActivity) to dedicated files
- [x] 07-02: Gap closure — Extract Experience timeline and Metrics sections to reach 400-line target

**Details:**

- Plan 01: Extracted 4 inline definitions, reduced page.tsx from 826 to 520 lines
- Plan 02: Extracted experience-timeline and metrics-section, reached 390 lines (target: under 400)
- Created components/sections/ directory pattern
- Created data/ directory with typed data files (tech-stack.ts, experience.ts)
- All extracted components are self-contained with "use client" directives

### Phase 8: Technical Debt

**Goal**: Fix async cleanup patterns and ensure documentation reflects current state
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (code splitting complete for accurate docs)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 08-01: Fix debounce cleanup and graph timer tracking
- [x] 08-02: Add GitHub API caching with 5-minute TTL
- [x] 08-03: Update documentation to reflect current structure

**Details:**

- Plan 01: Added .cancel() to debounce utility, timer tracking with useRef in graph-section, cleanup on unmount
- Plan 02: Module-level memory cache for GitHub API with 5-minute TTL
- Plan 03: Updated PROJECT.md and DESIGN.md to reflect modular architecture

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Extract sections to components (maintainability, reusability)
- Extract data to typed files (single source of truth, reuse)
- Timer tracking with useRef (prevents memory leaks on unmount)
- Memory cache over localStorage (simplicity, session-based data)
- Explicit colorMap for Tailwind class preservation (JIT purges dynamic classes)
- Self-contained components with "use client" directives

**Issues Resolved:**

- page.tsx was monolithic at 826 lines (reduced to 390)
- setTimeout chains had no cleanup (timer tracking added)
- Debounce utility had no cancel method (added .cancel())
- GitHub API called redundantly on remounts (5-minute cache added)
- 516 lines of dead code cluttering codebase (removed)
- 31 empty directories from scaffolded themes (removed)

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None
